# Knowledge-Incorporation-Mechanisms-From-Within-Phase-to-Cross-Phase
A repository documenting Knowledge Incorporation Mechanisms for Large Language Model (LLM)‑based agents, from within‑phase integration techniques to cross‑phase strategies. This project systematically defines, categorizes, and implements mechanisms that enable LLM agents to acquire, encode, and utilize task‑relevant knowledge throughout the agent lifecycle ,from initialization and development to inference.It notes that incorporating new knowledge across different tasks and phases is an ongoing process and includes practical examples and methods that relate to task needs and lifecycle stages.
